      // NOW. The point of the lab. Let's say you wanted to add a pop-up that dispayed the individual score for each marker.
      // You would have to add it in three different places (once for restaurants, coffeeshops, and book stores).
      // And then lets say you wanted the markers to be just a *little* bit smaller. You'd also have to make that change in 
      // three different places.
      //
      // Instead, what if instead of having this code mostly-duplicated in three different places, you could define a procedure
      // (In some languages functions are called procedures - same thing.)
      // and reuse this procedure for restaurants, coffeeshops, and book stores. Then when you wanted to make future changes,
      // you could just change that one centraly defined procedure, rather than having to make the same edit to the code that 
      // handles restaurants, again for coffee shops, and again for book stores.
      //
      // SO.
      // Step 1 - Identity the chunk of logic (code) that seems identical between the three category arrays (restaurants, coffeeShops, bookstores)
      // put that logic into a function that takes an array as an argument.
      //
      // Step 2 - replace all the duplicated code with the function. (so you'll use the function three times. Once for restaurants, once for 
      // coffee shops, and once for books stores
      //
      // Step 3 - Did you get color working? Or are they all the same color? Since the color should be different for each array,
      // we should add a "color" parameter to the function, and pass that in with the array.
      //
      // Once this is done, we should be functionally equivalent with the original code, but we're much better positioned to make changes
      // that affect our map without having to duplicate those changes everywher.
      //
      // Step 4 - Add a pop-up with the locations rating to each marker by modifying the shared procedure
      //
      // Step 5 - Tweak the radius of the "high score" radius to be a little smaller. Like maybe 14?
